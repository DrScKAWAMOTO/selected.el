* selected.el

=selected.el= provides the =selected-minor-mode= for Emacs. When =selected-minor-mode= is active, the keybindings in =selected-keymap= will be enabled when the region is active. This is useful for commands that operates on the region, which you only want bound to a key when the region is active.

=selected-keymap= has no default bindings. Bind it yourself:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'selected)
(define-key selected-keymap (kbd "q") #'selected-off)
(define-key selected-keymap (kbd "u") #'upcase-region)
(define-key selected-keymap (kbd "d") #'downcase-region)
(define-key selected-keymap (kbd "w") #'count-words-region)
(define-key selected-keymap (kbd "m") #'apply-macro-to-region-lines)
#+END_SRC

It is cleaner with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package selected
    :commands selected-minor-mode
    :bind (:map selected-keymap
                ("q" . selected-off)
                ("u" . upcase-region)
                ("d" . downcase-region)
                ("w" . count-words-region)
                ("m" . apply-macro-to-region-lines)))
#+END_SRC

Then activate it with =M-x selected-minor-mode=. It can be a good idea to add =selected-minor-mode= to the hooks of the major-modes where you want it activated. =selected-off= is a function which deactivates the keybindings until the next time the region becomes active. This is useful when you want to execute a command on the region, but then disable =selected-minor-mode= in favour of other commands like [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple-cursors]].

** Major mode specific bindings

You may want some keybindings to operate on the region, but only if you're in a certain major-mode. This is possible if you create a keymap named =selected-<major-mode>-map= (for instance =selected-org-mode-map=) and add the mode-specific bindings there. Here's an example, using =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package selected
    :commands selected-minor-mode
    :init
    (setq selected-org-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
    :bind (:map selected-keymap
                ("q" . selected-off)
                ("u" . upcase-region)
                ("d" . upcase-region)
                ("w" . count-words-region)
                ("m" . apply-macro-to-region-lines)
                :map selected-org-mode-map
                ("t" . org-table-convert-region)))
#+END_SRC
